Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

- App: contain the entire page
- Mode: change mode (light/dark)
- TodoInput: receive user input
- TodoList: display & filter todo list based on user choice
- TodoRow: display a single todo + delete + mark as complete
- TodoListFooter: display a stat & allow the user to clear completed todos
                      - Stat
                      - ClearButton
- ToDoListFilter: allow the user to filter todo list


###arrange them into a hierarchy

- App
        - Mode
        - TodoInput
        - TodoList
                - Todo
                - TodoListFooter
                        - Stat
                        - ClearButton
                - FilterList

Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

- Dark mode option 
- the input text the user has entered
- the list of todos
- the value of the checkbox (to mark a todo as completed)
- the cross icon (to delete a todo)
- the number of uncompleted todos
- the button to clear completed todos
- the three buttons to filter the todo list

My state is:
- Dark mode option 
- the input text the user has entered
- the list of todos
- the value of the checkbox (to mark a todo as completed) X
